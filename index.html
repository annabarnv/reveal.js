          <aside class="notes">
            A Common KISS Code Smell is when you’re reading code and
             it’s either complicated or hard to follow, sometimes,
              if you find yourself asking in your mind “What’s going on”,
               “I can’t follow those code”, “I’m super confused with what I’m reading right now”,
                then you have a good indicator that the KISS principle has been broken

          <aside class="notes">
            Another mistake that is often made dealing with the KISS principle is that
             people try to make code as short as possible. But the shortest solution is
              rather seldom the easiest to read. Consider the following "Non-KISS" example:<br>
              Sure, the first version is also readable, but it is considerably harder to do so.
               Adding a few descriptive names, type hints, and splitting the line into multiple ones gets clearly easier to read.<br>
               One of many common bad practices of developers is to create fancy and unreadable "oneliners".
                There is absolutely no reason to do so. This will most certainly lead to someone,
                 if not themself struggling to decipher it.

            <aside class="notes">
              To solve the KISS principle one thing is to refactor your code.
               How exactly do you refactor complex code, well there is no straight answer
                / there is no correct answer. Basically you just play around with other ways of writing
                 code until you get to a solution that is less complex.

                 The more you’re write the easier you’ll spot it in time because over time
                  you’re gonna say to yourself “Wow this is really hard to read/write how can I make this easier”
